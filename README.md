# Mikebot
A bot for the mike wazowski impression club
pretty messy tbh

Start script creates a .env file which then should be edited as follows:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN = [String] : the bot token from the discord developer page
DISCORD_GUILD = [Number] :  the guild's id
TICTACTOE = [Number] : the id of the channel where tictactoe can be played
```
